            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wherbi we mai learn how greatly God is infenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt iniquitie, in ſo much that he will rather bring in vpon his own children a nation more wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked: then to leaue them vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, to run forward in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked race.

                  <note place="margin">Haſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nany.</note> otherwiſe called <hi>Chaſmonany.</hi> The prieſt enioyned them to faſte, and puniſhe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues before the lorde with wepinge, ſackeclothe, and aſſhes, and after this he ſaith vnto them. If ye wil ieoparde your liues for the holy Lorde, why die we like women: Let vs go and fight with <hi>Polipus,</hi> and if we die, wee ſhal die with honour: peraduenture the holie and bleſſed God wil helpe vs, and will not roote out the remnaunt of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racll.

Thou ſhalt be their prince alſo, if thou wilt be conformable. But the prieſt in no wiſe woulde bee ſeduced by him, but rather curſed and reuiled him. <hi>Mattathias</hi> had an aulter at the fote of the hill, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon when he had offered Sacrifice to
<pb facs="tcp:22889:14"/>the moſt bleſſed God, there came one of the wicked Iſraelites oute of <hi>Polipus</hi> campe, and killed vpon it a ſwine. This villaine was yong and luſtye, but the prteſt was olde: yet when he ſaw what this lewde felow had done, criyng vnto his god to help him &amp; ſtrenthen him, he chalenged a combate betwene him ſelf &amp; the felow. Which thinge being liked both of the felowe, and of <hi>Polipus</hi> with his whole Armye: <hi>Mattathias</hi> came downe wyth his drawen ſworde in his hande, and the felow ſtode againſt him readye to receiue him. But the prieſte ruſſhed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him by the aſſiſtence of his god, ouercame him, cut of his head, and caſt his carcas vpon the aulter, wherat <hi>Polipus</hi> and his whole hoſt were much aſtonied, beholdyng one another. The prieſte ſtode ſtill by the aulter, criynge: whiche of you wil come to me man for man? The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Polipus</hi> picked out a ſtrong champion, the beſt in all his armye, and brought him out of the arayes of hys hoſte to teache him his leſſon, howe he ſhould behaue him ſelfe with the prieſt.
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:22889:14"/>The prieſte therfore drewe toward the Campe with hys naked ſworde in hys hand, as though he came to ioyne with their Champion: but afterwardes lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge him, he turned his ſworde vpon <hi>Polipus,</hi> ſtroke of his heade, and fledde to the hill. Then blowing their hornes and makynge a ſhoute together, they ruſſhed doun vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Grecians campe. But when the Grecians ſaw that their graunde captaine was ſlaine, they fled. <hi>Chaſmonany</hi> and his ſonnes with all Iſraell folowed the chaſe, ouerthrewe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and made a great ſlaughter. This done, <hi>Mattathias</hi> the prieſt went to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, purified the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, reſtored the worſhippyng of god: &amp; commaunded al that were born during the time of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipus</hi> to be circumciſed, for bi the means of his inhibition, they were vncircu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Thus being eſtabliſhed, he ſate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the throne of the kingdome, and droue the Grekes out of the lande of Iſraell. His kingdome endured one yere, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was the .cc. xii. yere fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the building of the ſeconde houſe. After this he fell
<pb facs="tcp:22889:15"/>ſicke, and like to die, charged his ſonnes to kepe the obſeruations of the Lorde, and to walke in his waies. Alſo to play the men againſte the Grecians for the religion of the Lord. Then brought he forth <hi>Iudas,</hi> a tall man and a hardy, and placynge him in the ſanctuarie, toke a horne of oyle, and poured it vppon his head, wherat all the Iſraelites clapped their handes, and gaue a great ſhoute, ſaiynge: God ſaue the kinge, God ſaue the kinge. Sone after <hi>Iudas</hi> gathered an armie of Iſrael, and made an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion againſt the re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nant of the Grekes that were left in the holdes of Iſraell, and whatſoeuer he toke in hande, God gaue it good ſucceſſe. Notwithſtanding <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſent againſt him a puiſſant army vnder the leadyng of one captain <hi>Pelonius,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Iudas</hi> ſo war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Grecians went to wrack, for he eſpied his tyme when they were deſtitute of victuals, and ſpedely ſet v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, beat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doune handſmoth, &amp; approched to captain <hi>Pelonius,</hi> ſlew the valiaunteſt about him, yea &amp; him alſo.
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:22889:15"/>When <hi>Antiochus</hi> heard of this, he was in a great rage: wherefore he choſe out a moſt valiaunt captaine called <hi>Liſias,</hi> and ſent him againſt Hieruſalem with a thouſande horſemen, and fotemenne without number. <hi>Iudas</hi> hauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therof, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded a faſt through out all Iſrael for three daies after, toke muſter of all his armie, and made ouer them captains of thouſands, hundreds, fifties, and tennes. Theſe ſaide to their ſouldiours. <hi>VVho ſo euer is aferde. &amp;c.</hi> Wherupon many of the people retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home, yet there remayned .vii. M. and fiue hundred of ſuche courage all, that one would not haue runne awaye from an hundreth. <hi>Liſias</hi> deuided his hoſte into three partes, committing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto three capitaines, <hi>Nicanor, Bagris,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomee.</hi> But after the Iſraelites had once geuen a great ſhoute: the lord beat downe the Grekes, ſo that the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, deſtroyed nine thouſand horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of them, &amp; ſpoyled the whole hoſt, and they that remayned alyue, tooke them ſelues to flight. The next daye
<pb facs="tcp:22889:16"/>Kynge <hi>Iudas</hi> kepte his Sabboth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wyth all Iſraell in the campe, for the battayle was vppon the ſixte daye. The morowe after the Iſraelites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the ſpoyle of thoſe that were kylled, and after to purſue other that were not able to reſiſt: but they founde none, for they were fled into <hi>Aſtaroth Karnaiim.</hi> Durynge the tyme of this warres, <hi>Antiochus</hi> inuaded the land of Perſia, for they hadde moued warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte hym, and done hym iniurye. Wherfore he fought againſt them: but hauynge the ouerthrowe at their han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, he retourned to <hi>Antiochia</hi> wyth great ſhame, where alſo he founde hys armyes wyth an other diſhonoure and foyle. Wherewyth he was in ſuche a rage, that he gathered together all the valiaunteſt and beſte Warriours in al Grecia: yea, all that were able to beare weapon, ſwearinge he woulde bringe with him ſuche an armye, that all the grounde about Hieruſalem ſhould not ſuffice theim to ſtande vppon that hee woulde haue wyth him, euen for hys
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:22889:16"/>ſotemen onelye. And ſo he ſet forwarde his horſemen with horſes and wagons laden with all maner of furnitures for the warres, as Bowes, ſhieldes, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, ſwordes, and ſpeares, breſtplates, and mourens, beſides a huge noumber of Elephantes: and ſuche, that a doſen valiant men might fight vpon one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant, the Elephants being to them as a Fortreſſe. But kinge <hi>Iudas</hi> toke heart to him, put his truſte in his God, and ioyned battaile with him. At len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gth when he with the power of Iſrael approched to the Elephants, they ſlew theim downe right, ſo that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantes roared, the Horſes and all the beaſtes that caried the baggage and furnitures were verie ſoore afrayed. Kinge <hi>Antiochus</hi> alſo beinge mounted vppon his mare, and not able to ſit her in her flight, was throwen downe.

The Lorde had plaged him alſo and his whole hoſte before with a drye ſcabbe, or rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mattier, and with other moſt horrible diſeaſes: which as he ſaw he confeſſed it to be the hande of God. Wherfore he made a vowe, that if he eſcaped, be woulde circumciſe him ſelfe with all his ſouldiours, and would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert them to the worſhippynge of the God of Iſrael: but God heard him not. He fledde therfore a fote as well as he might, and died bi the way through his greuous and ſoore diſeaſes, and <hi>Opiter</hi> his ſonne raigned in his ſtede. Kynge <hi>Iudas</hi> with all Iſraell retourned wyth great ioye to the houſe of the Lord, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſacrifices: and as they had layed wodde vpon the alter, and the ſacrifice vpon that: they called vnto the Lorde, louingly to accept their ſacrifice, and in the meane ſpace, fire came forthe of the aulter by the owne accorde, conſumed the ſacrifice, and the wodde, the lyke neuer chaunced vnto them to this day.

Whereat the kinge helde his peace and gaue neuer a worde to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. So all the ioye was daſhed and turned into ſadneſſe. The next day, at the commaundement of the king, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations went out to all the Cities in the kinges dominions, that they ſhoulde ſtande to the ordenaunce of <hi>Sadoch</hi> and <hi>Bithus:</hi> and who ſoeuer ſhould refence to folow their decrees, or would obſerue the tradicions of the Sages and obey their wil: ſhuld ſuffer death. This was Ihon the hie prieſt, whiche had the prieſthode. xl. yeares, and in thend became a <hi>Saducie.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinge the Iſraelites obeyed not the kinges commaundement, but rather priuilye followed the orders of the ſages. The king him ſelfe and all his ſeruantes, folowed the traditions
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:22889:26"/>of the <hi>Saducies,</hi> making inquiſition for them that ſtake to the conſtitutions of the Sages: and putting to deathe, as many as he coulde get knowledge of. By this meanes he drue much people of Iſrael into this opinion. The time that <hi>Hircanus</hi> reygned ouer Iſraell was .xxxi. yere, and then he died. After him reigned his ſonne <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> for he had .iii. ſonnes, <hi>Ariſtobulus, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi> This <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> was hated of his father and bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out of his preſence. He went ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and made warre vpon <hi>Tire</hi> and <hi>Sidon:</hi> ſubdued them and compelled them to be circumciſed. <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not the high prieſthode, but ſet light by it, wherfore he wold not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the office therof, but toke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vppon him, and ſet the crowne vppon his heade: and was called the great king. Beſides this he baniſhed his mother and <hi>Alexander</hi> her ſonne his yonger brother, and wold not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to dwell in Ieruſalem. But he loued his brother <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:22889:27"/>made him lieuetenant generall of all his warres, ſetting him forward into the warres againſte hys ennemies. Wherin the yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Antigonus</hi> had good fortune, and proſpered in al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that he toke in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and returned ſafe to Ieruſalem. Wheras he entred into the houſe of the ſanctuary to pray for his brother the king, which at that time was greuouſly ſicke: and alſo to acknowledge before the Lorde God, his goodneſſe and mercye towardes him, in that he aided him againſt his enemies. Then came a certain wicked perſon vnto the king, &amp; informed him with this tale. Thy brother (ſaith he) returning from the warres, inquyred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of thy health, &amp; when it was told him thou waſt ſicke, he ſaide: I will go to him to day, &amp; rid him out of the world. When the kinge heard this, he was wrothe towarde the ſages: commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his brother to be apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and caried to the palaice of <hi>Starton,</hi> there to be kepte in priſonne till he hadde made inquiſition of his doinges.</p>
               <pb n="xix" facs="tcp:22889:27"/>
               <p>In the meane ſpace the Quene the kinges wife commaunded him to be put to death there without knowlege of the kinges minde. But when the Kinge hearde that hys brother was killed, he cried mainly out and wepte, ſmiting his breſt in ſuch a ſorte with his hande, that he ſowned, and muche blud iſſued out of his mouth. He reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ouer Iſrael .ii. yere. After him his brother <hi>Alexander</hi> reigned, who was alſo called king <hi>Ianai,</hi> being broughte out of priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where his brother had put him, and made king of Iſrael. He was a mighty man, and valeante in all his warres againſt his ennemies, preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He had warres with the Philiſtines, namelye <hi>Azam</hi> and <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> whom he put to the worſſe, and ouercame them. This man refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not the prieſthode, but was his prieſt. It chaunced on a time, when he ſtode at thaltare to offer ſacrifice: one of the ſages caſt <hi>Ceder</hi> trée vpon him, wherat he lift vp his righthand vpon the altare, crying: geue me my ſword.
<pb facs="tcp:22889:28"/>Then the Sages kneled down before him, and ſware they did it not of anye contempt, but rather (ſay thei) that we thus ſporting before the Lord, would be mery vpon the hie ſolempne daye. But the kinges ſeruauntes anſwered roughly again, ſaiynge: Althoughe ye play and reioyie, yet it is not the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the country to vſe any ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitful cuſtome with the king. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencion waxed hot amongſte them, til at the length the Sages ſpake euil of the king, caſtinge in his tethe that he was an vnhallowed and ſuſpended perſon, and that his grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dmother on the fathers ſide was a captiue in the mount <hi>Modiit,</hi> wherby her ſeede was ſteined. The king was ſore moued at that, in ſo much that he commaunded all the Sages to be ſlaine. Therefore, wher ſo euer they founde them, in the ſanctuary or in the ſtretes of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: they killed them forthwith. Then the king commaunded that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould obei the gouernaunce and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions of the <hi>Saducies.</hi> So in thoſe
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:22889:28"/>daies had the Sages great tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſome fel vpon the ſworde, ſome fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, and ſome taried at home with diſhonor and ſhame. After theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the king made an expedicion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Arabia,</hi> entred the country as farre as the rocke of the wildernes, againſt <hi>Hartam</hi> kinge of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and ſubdued his lande. After that he warred vpon <hi>Medaba,</hi> and the hole lande of <hi>Moab,</hi> vanquiſhing them, and bringing them vnder tribute: and ſo retourned with honor to Ieruſalem. When he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this wel bethought him of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, it repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him of his euil waies: wherfore he altered his minde and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make much of the Sages, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to their ordinaunce, and eſtemed their tradicions. There were alſo at that time a kinde of ſecte that were called
<note place="margin">* Theſe I take to be the ſame that he cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth ſages before.</note> 
                  <hi>Phariſeis,</hi> of whom ſuch as had eſcaped, the kinge ſente to call them home again, and when they wer come into his preſence, he ſpake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them comfortable wordes, ſaying: My brethern, ye ſhal vnderſtand that,
<pb facs="tcp:22889:29"/>that is once done and paſt, muſt nedes be termed as it is, and can not be reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. And truth it is you can excuſe the reproche that ye did me: nor I can not call againe the bloud that I haue ſhed. Notwithſtanding, I confeſſe my faulte vnto you, and haue chaunged my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation to loue: praiynge you to put out of your heart all rancour and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, laye awaie alſo your mournynge and ſorowfulneſſe of your mindes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyſyng in your reconciliation and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onement with me, &amp; be of good cheare. But they made him anſwere. We wil not laie away our hatred and enmitie, for thou ſpeakeſt but diſceitfully, &amp; we ſpeake that is truthe. Furthermore, thou haſt killed our chief men and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, neither haſt thou onely done vs this iniurie: but alſo <hi>Hircanus</hi> thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who began ſuch miſchiefe, &amp; thou haſt holden on and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued it. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this hatred betwene thee and vs hath taken ſome roote: neither can we leaue our ſorowe and mourninge, tyll thou dye, and God take vengeaunce
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:22889:29"/>vpon thee for our ſakes, then ſhal wee reioice, when we ſee vengeaunce. So they departed from his preſence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the kinge euer geue them any anſwere. But when thei perceiued the kinge to be incenſed againſt them, and by that meanes the matter mighte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounde to their owne harme: after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation had, they went to the king of Grece, whoſe name was <hi>Demetrius,</hi> ſhewed him what <hi>Hircanus</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne had done vnto the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeis</hi> and all the Iſraelites that bare them good will, and folowed their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: and how thei alſo hated <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> for the miſchiefe that hee hathe wrought them. So that if any manne would come and reueng the malice of <hi>Alexander,</hi> they would be ready to aide him. <hi>Demetrius</hi> folowed their aduiſe, and aſſembling together all his people to the number of .xl. thouſand horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and fotemen without number. He toke his iourney, and encamped againſt <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem.</hi> Then kinge <hi>Alexander</hi> waged .vi. thouſand horſemen to aid him. But
<pb facs="tcp:22889:30"/>the king of the Grecians writ priuilye to the auncientes of the <hi>Sectaries</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhold not aide <hi>Alexander.</hi> To the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinary ſouldiours alſo that <hi>Alexander</hi> had hired, he ſent rewardes golde and ſiluer, that they returned home to their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, &amp; aided not <hi>Alexander.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was not able to withſtande <hi>Demetrius.</hi> Therfore hearing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> was remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Sichem</hi> toward Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, entending to take him in the citie: he fled by nighte with a fewe of his men to the mountains, and lurked there. When the menne of Iſrael that were in <hi>Iudea</hi> heard the king was fled out of Hieruſalem, and that the citye was in haſarde to come into the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of the Grecians: they gathered them ſelues together, &amp; ſtode for their liues as thoughe all had bene one man, to the number of .x. thouſand, and ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This done, the king toke hart vnto him, &amp; returned to his kingdom,

                  <hi>Phariſes</hi> fled to <hi>Betſhemes,</hi> ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues againſt the king.

Then ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queted he al his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants vpon the roufe of his palaice in a very hie place, where the chiefe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men eat &amp; dranke, vntil he and thei were dronke. And in his merye mode he commaunded thoſe .viii.c. <hi>Phariſies</hi> priſoners to be brought forth &amp; to be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

After this he fel ſick y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> xxiiii. yere of his raigne, of a greuous diſeaſe, a quartan ague y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> held him thre yere: yet for all this he ſhronke not, nor letted to go to the war, to encounter &amp; fight with his enemies what nation ſo euer they were of round about him, as though he had ben a hole man. In the xxvii. yere of his raign, which was the third of his ſicknes, he made an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the land of <hi>Moab</hi> againſt a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain city called <hi>Ragaba,</hi> to get it bi force
<pb facs="tcp:22889:31"/>At which time he was very ſicke and weake, wherfore his wife <hi>Alexandra</hi> the Quene wente with him, fearinge leaſt he ſhuld die by the waye. And as be encamped him ſelf againſt the city, and vrged it ſore with aſſaultes, his ſickneſſe increaſed vpon him more and more. Wherfore his wife perceiuinge that he was like to die, wept bitterly before him, &amp; ſaid. To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal I be ſo bold as to ſhew my face, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou art once dead, ſeing thou haſte wroughte ſuch miſchief vpon the phariſies, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the lande fauoureth, and foloweth their traditions, obeiyng their inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions? If they ſhalbe diſpoſed to wreke them ſelues vppon me and thy yonge children, they ſhal haue aid of all that dwel in the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. The king anſwered.

In the meane while, anointe &amp; ſeaſon me with balmes, fight with a courage againſt this city til thou win it, &amp; then return to Ieruſalem with ioy: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware thou put on no mourninge ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parail, nor weepe, but bringe me into Ieruſalem and laye me vpon a bedde like a ſicke man, and after call toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the chiefe of the Phariſeis, bryng them where I am, and ſpeake vnto them gentilly in this ſort. <hi>Alexander</hi> hath bene euer your enemy. I knowe it very wel: wherefore take him if ye liſt and caſt him into the fire, or to the dogges, or bury him, it ſhalbe at your choiſe. I knowe wel, they are pitifull men and ſo ful of merci, that they wil bury me honorably, and ſhall apointe ſome one of my ſonnes who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they like beſt to be king. The Quene did ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ſhe was inſtructed of the king. Whan ſhe had won <hi>Ragaba,</hi> ſhe ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully returned to Ieruſalem: after that gathered together the elders of the
<pb facs="tcp:22889:32"/>Phariſies and ſpake to them as the king had aduiſed her. The Phariſies hearing the king was deade, and that his bodye was in their handes to do withal what they liſte, they anſwered the Quene: God forbid, we ſhoulde do this vnto our Lorde the annointed of God. He was the king and hie prieſte: what though he were a ſinner, yet his deathe ſhalbe an expiation for him of al his iniquities. Therfore we wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile him and mourne for him: yea, we wil cary his coffen our ſelues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our neckes and burye him as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a kinges magnificence, and ſo they did. The time that he reigned was .xxvii. yeares. After him reigned his wife <hi>Alexandra</hi> in his ſtede, for the Phariſies after they had finiſhed the .vii. daies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mourning, they comitted the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto her. She had .ii. ſons by the king: the elder was called <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> the other <hi>Ariſtobulus. Hircanus</hi> was a iuſt man &amp; righteous, but <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtobulus</hi> was the warrioure &amp; man of prowes: beſides that, of a familier &amp;

But <hi>Hircanus</hi> his elder brother, lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued the Phariſies.

The Quene gaue them no word to anſwer: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> was angrye, and letted not to vtter it to his mothers face, but ſhe would not heare him. Wherefore <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> counſeled the <hi>Sectaries</hi> to go their waies and depart oute of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, to chuſe them cities in the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of <hi>Iuda</hi> where they mighte dwel with their honor: &amp; not to ſuffre them ſelues to be ſlain vnder the Phariſies hands.

The time that he reigned ouer Iſrael was four yeares and ſixe monethes. He was a good man of war, hardy in fighte, and a man of an amiable countenaunce. <hi>Pompeius</hi> receiuinge tidinges of his deathe: the more gladder proceded

But <hi>Iulius</hi> met him in the waye, and deſtroyed him and his hoſte: whereby the Empire was eſtabliſhed vnto <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> He after this ſente preſentes to the kinge of <hi>Siria</hi> and into Egipte by his captaines, to allure them to his frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe. <hi>Antipater</hi> aduiſed <hi>Hircanus</hi> to aide <hi>Iulius</hi> if perchaunce he might win his fauour, whiche <hi>Hircanus</hi> did: and <hi>Antipater</hi> was captaine of the hoſte, who plaied the man, and founde ſuche fauoure with <hi>Iulius,</hi> that he made him lieuetenant of his warres. And after he had fought ſondry &amp; great battails, he retourned to Ieruſalem with great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure, and by the way proſpered much more. <hi>Hircanus</hi> after this, made <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelus Antipaters</hi> ſonne gouerned of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem: and <hi>Herod</hi> his third ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of Galily. There was a certaine yong man at that time in Ieruſalem, called <hi>Hizkias,</hi> a valeant man of war: to whom claue al ſuch as were in any diſtreſſe, and he became their captain.

                  <hi>Siria,</hi> rouing and murthering in ſuch ſort, that the <hi>Sirians</hi> were wery of their liues, for feare of them. Wherefore the king of <hi>Siria</hi> ſent vnto <hi>Herode,</hi> ruler of <hi>Galily,</hi> deſiring him to kil that <hi>Hizkias</hi> &amp; his complices.

Therefore they willed him to depart from Ieruſalem, vnto whom he condiſcended, after he had once let the

And for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he ſo ſore oppreſſed the Iewes thei therfore hated him, and conſpired

<pb facs="tcp:22889:50"/>and <hi>Herode</hi> came forthe to mete him, embraſed him, &amp; kiſſed him: after brought him into his houſe, and feaſted him dayly, called him his father before all men, albeit in his hearte he conſpired to murther him. And that knewe <hi>Alexandra</hi> his doughter and mother in lawe to <hi>Herode:</hi> who ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it vnto <hi>Hircanus,</hi> but he wold not credite her at the firſt, til on a time he perceiued the matter cleare to be ſo, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deuiſed he how to flee to <hi>Maloc</hi> kynge of <hi>Arabia.</hi> He ſent therfore a meſſenger to <hi>Maloc,</hi> to ſend him hors and a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret to flee withall: but the meſſenger dealt vnfaithfully &amp; lewdly with him, for he broughte <hi>Hircanus</hi> letters priue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto <hi>Herode,</hi> who rewarded hym well for his laboure, and bad him goe to <hi>Maloc,</hi> and to let hym knowe what aunſwere <hi>Maloc</hi> gaue. The meſſenger vpon this went and deliuered the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>Maloc,</hi> who fulfilled <hi>Hircanus</hi> requeſt, ſent him horſes and a charet, writing in this ſorte. I haue ſent the horſes &amp; horſemen: come therfore vnto
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:22889:50"/>me, and whatſoeuer thy hart deſireth, I wil do it for thy ſake. So the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brought the aunſwer ſecretly vnto <hi>Herode:</hi> wherupon he ſent ſtreight to the place in whiche he vnderſtode <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loces</hi> men to lurke, waiting for <hi>Hirca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi> and cauſed to apprehende them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue. <hi>Herode</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to cal together the elders, before whome he willed alſo <hi>Hircanus</hi> to be brought, and of him the king demaunded. Tell me if thou writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt any letters to <hi>Maloc</hi> king of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia?</hi> he aunſwered: I wrote none. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was <hi>Reſtius</hi> the meſſenger brought in as his accuſer, and the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of war alſo of <hi>Arabia</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were apprehended, which declared the hole matter before the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, ſo that <hi>Hircanus</hi> was quite daſſhed. Then the king co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him to bee put to death, and ſo was the kingdome eſtabliſſhed vnto <hi>Herode.</hi> The tyme that <hi>Hircanus</hi> reigned, was fourty yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res and ſixe monethes. After the death of his mother he reigned thre yeares, and <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> his brother remoued hym, makynge hym prieſt. Agayne
<pb facs="tcp:22889:51"/>thre yeares after he returned to his kingdome, and raigned fourty yeares. Then <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſonne of <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> depoſed hym, cuttynge of his eare, &amp; baniſhing him out of the holy citie. So after when <hi>Herode</hi> his ſeruaunte came to the kingedome:
<note place="margin">Herodes ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> he returned to Ieruſalem, and <hi>Herode</hi> ſhed his bloud without cauſe. Yet he notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng had deliuered <hi>Herode</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hands of the elders, who would haue put him to death, for the death of <hi>Hizkias.</hi> From that time <hi>Hircanus</hi> wrought none euil in the ſight of the Lorde, nor offended him in any great matter: ſaue onely in this, that he bare to much with <hi>Herod</hi> in ſheadyng the innocent bloud, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his owne life wente for the other. Therfore happy is he that neuer forget teth any part of his dutye. <hi>Marimi</hi> the daughter of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> the wyfe of <hi>Herode,</hi> had a brother whoſe name was <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus:</hi> hym <hi>Herode</hi> woulde in no wiſe promote to the hye prieſthode becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe he feared the children of <hi>Chaſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nany,</hi>

But the kyng made hye prieſt one that was nothing of the kinred of <hi>Chaſmonany,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Haniel</hi> Notwithſtandynge when he had once made awaye <hi>Hircanus</hi> his wiues pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitour, father of <hi>Alexandra</hi> his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in lawe: then he depoſed <hi>Haniel</hi> the hie prieſt, and promoted his wiues brother <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> to the dignitie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were but a child: yet he was wiſe, and of good vnderſtandyng, and beautifull withall, ſo that in al Iſraell was not a goodlier nor hanſomer yong man the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was. And this <hi>Haniel</hi> was the firſt that euer was depoſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that office of the hie prieſthode, by any king of Iſrael afore <hi>Herode:</hi> who did this to quiet his wyfe, and to fulfil his mother in lawes minde.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andra</hi> had red the letter, ſhe ſent to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtobulus</hi> her ſonne the hie prieſt, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing him that ſhe wold flee to the ſea <hi>Iapho,</hi> and from thence wold take ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into <hi>Egipt,</hi> perſwading him alſo to flee with her. We wil (ſaith ſhe) make two great coffers, one for my ſelf &amp; the other for thee: &amp; we wil with rewardes procure our ſeruauntes to cary vs oute priuily, wherby we may flee to ſaue our liues. This their deuiſe was perceiued of one of <hi>Herodes</hi> ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, who forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king priuie vnto it. The king co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded his ſeruaunt that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraied them, that when they did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uey the coffers they ſhoulde bring them to him, whiche the ſeruauntes did. So
<pb n="xliiii" facs="tcp:22889:52"/>when the coffers were broughte to the kinges preſence, he cauſed them to bee opened, and tooke out <hi>Alexandra</hi> &amp; her ſonne <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> to whom the kynge ſpake ſharpely and rebuked them ſore. But <hi>Alexandra</hi> aunſwered him again as ſhort, in ſomuch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the king moued with anger, flang away from her into his chamber, ſaiyng: It is better to ſit in a corner of the houſe, then with a brawling &amp; ſkolding woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in an open place. The king diſſembled the matter &amp; ſhewed no great diſpleaſure. A yeare after as <hi>Ariſtobulꝰ</hi> the hie prieſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>railed in his ponticall veſtures, ſtode in the the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple nie vnto the alter to offer ſacrifices: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſraelites beheld his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, his wiſdome, &amp; behauiour in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, wherat euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reioyſed, prai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing God that had not taken al away, but left one to reuenge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iniuries done to the houſe of <hi>Chaſmonani.</hi> The kyng hearyng this, was ſore afrayed, and not a litle diſpleaſed: thinking to him ſelfe the Iſraelites woulde reſtore the kyngdome of their fathers vnto hym.
<pb facs="tcp:22889:53"/>He perceiued euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hart to be incli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned towards him. Wherfore he delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated a while, &amp; in the feaſte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to <hi>Iericho</hi> withal his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, wheras he made a great feaſt to al his nobles and ſeruaunts, placing them euery man after his degree before him. <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> the hie prieſt, he ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his righthand. And as they eate, dronke, &amp; made mery: the kinges ſeruants were diſpoſed to go and ſwim in <hi>Iordane.</hi> To theſe the king had geuen ſecret co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente, that they ſhoulde deſire <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> to go and bathe with them in <hi>Iordane,</hi> and then to drown him. So when they were goinge, they came to <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> &amp; deſired him to go bathe with them, which he would not vnleſſe the kinge gaue him leaue: wherfore he aſked the king leaue, but he denied him at the firſt, yet at length the yong man intreated him ſo inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, that the king bad him do what he would. He wente therfore with the other yong menne to ſwim. The king toke his horſſe ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye and returned to <hi>Iericho</hi> withall
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:22889:53"/>his traine, leauinge the yonge men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, which continued ſwimming till Sunne ſetting: and as it began to be darke they drowned the prieſte <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> emongſt them. Wherof when ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges came to the kinge, and it was knowen that he was deade: the people wept and made great lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tacion: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering his vertue, nobility, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, euery man was ful of ſorow that he ſhould haue ſo ſhort a life: and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed ſo much that it was harde a far of. But <hi>Marimi</hi> chiefly and <hi>Alexandra</hi> the yonge mannes mother could in no wiſe be comforted. Yea, the kinge alſo wept and made great moane, for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented him that he had done ſo wicked an acte. Yet all the people knewe well inough, that the thinge was procured by the king: In ſo much that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi> his mother in law letted not to tell it him to his face, that he was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer of her huſband, and her father, &amp; now laſt of al of her ſonne: to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king anſwered nether good nor bad. From that daye forwardes there was
<pb facs="tcp:22889:54"/>perpetual hatred betwene <hi>Alexandra</hi> &amp; <hi>Marimi,</hi> and <hi>Kiparim</hi> the mother of <hi>Herode,</hi> &amp; <hi>Salumith</hi> his ſiſter that came of baſe &amp; ſeruile blud. For <hi>Marimi</hi> caſt in their teethe to their faces, that they wer not of the ſede of Iſrael: but vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; of baſe birth. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode</hi> loued <hi>Marimi</hi> as his life, wherfore he would neuer diſpleaſe her as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as ſhe liued, nor ſay ſo much to her as whi ſaieſt thou ſo? Theſe thinges done, <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> a noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Rome, next vnto <hi>Octauian Auguſtus</hi> kinge of kinges, being ſent by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to war vpon the kinges of the weſt countries: raigned in <hi>Egipt,</hi> &amp; by the prouocation of his wife rebelled againſt <hi>Octauian Auguſtus,</hi> made war with him both by ſea &amp; land. And foraſmuch as Egipt is nie adioyninge to the lande of Iſraell, <hi>Herode</hi> ioyned with him and helped him. For <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> had aided him before in ſuch ſorte, that no kinge durſt meddle with him for fear of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Antonius.</hi> Wherupon whan <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> conſpired againſte hys prynce and

Herode</hi> hearinge that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Antonius</hi> was ſlaine, and that <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauian Auguſtus</hi> was come into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipte:</hi> he fainted for feare of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of <hi>Octauian.</hi> Yet at lengthe he tooke hearte vnto him, prepared a royall preſente to be caried afore him, and folowed after him ſelfe to <hi>Octaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Auguſtus.</hi> And ſetting forwardes, he called <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the huſband of <hi>Salum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith</hi> his ſiſter, whome he made chiefe of his houſhold: commaundinge him that if <hi>Octauian Auguſtus</hi> put him to death: he ſhuld poiſon <hi>Marimi</hi> his wife, ſaying: it ſhuld not be ſemely for kinges that any meane &amp; baſe man ſhuld mary with a kinges widow, and ſleepe wyth her vppon a kinges bedde. So then he toke his iourney toward <hi>Octauian Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> who then was at the <hi>Rhodes,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:22889:55"/>where he vnderſtode <hi>Octauian</hi> to be diſpleaſed with him, for that he had ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Marcus Antonius.</hi> Therfore aſſone as <hi>Herode</hi> came to <hi>Octauian Auguſtus</hi> preſence, hauinge his croune vpon his head: he toke it of, &amp; fel down proſtrate vppon the ground at <hi>Octauians</hi> feete, ſaying: Moſt noble emperour, I confeſſe my treſpaſſe againſt your maieſty, that I loued <hi>M.

Emongſt al theſe thinges I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that I wolde not be counted of your

Wherfore whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhal pleaſe your maieſty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore me to my former eſtate or no, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as I haue kept touch with <hi>M.

When <hi>Octauian Auguſt</hi> herd him ſpeake ſo, he ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: Ariſe thou kinge of Iſraell in peace, be of good comfort and fear not, for thou art worthy to be nie, yea, next to my perſon. I knowe that <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> was ſet on by his wife, and would not folow thy counſel, for if he had, I dare ſaye he woulde neuer haue conſpired againſt me. So he commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the croune to be ſet againe vppon <hi>Herodes</hi> head, and made a leage with him. Then they went both together to ward Egipt to be reuenged vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra.</hi> But that wicked woman whan ſhe ſaw her city to be ouercome: put on her moſte precious apparaile, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon the throne of her kingdom:

As <hi>Octauian Auguſt</hi> came to her palaire &amp; ſawe her ſit there, he reioyced that he mighte be reuenged of her: and commaunded to thruſte her from her throne, but when they that came to her founde her dead, <hi>Octauian</hi> was penſife and verye ſore greued. In this while Ioſeph <hi>Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mithes</hi> huſbande diſcloſed vnto <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi> that the kinge had commaunded: if it ſo fortuned him to be put to deathe by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that he ſhoulde poyſon her: Wherupon <hi>Marimi</hi> conceiued yet a greater hatred towarde the kinge, in ſo muche that when the kinge was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned in ſafetye, ſounde, and with honoure alſo from <hi>Octauian,</hi> and that all his menne and whole houſhoulde reioyſed greatelye: <hi>Marimi</hi> ſhewed no countenaunce of gladneſſe, no not when the kinge him ſelfe told her how greatlye he was magnified and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of <hi>Octauian:</hi> but alwaies ſhe was ſadde. <hi>Salumith</hi> the kinges Siſter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:22889:56"/>that <hi>Marimi</hi> ſo vexed the king, ſhe toulde him howe <hi>Ioſeph</hi> her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande had line with <hi>Marimi</hi> whiles he was with <hi>Auguſtus. Herode</hi> (ſaye what ſhe could) gaue no credite to her wordes, knowing that ſhe enuied <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimi:</hi> vntill at length he aſked the cauſe of <hi>Marimi</hi> whye ſhe reioyſed not as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did when he returned in ſafetye from <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> but was euer ſad, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſhewed her to haue ſome rancoure and malice in her heart to wardes him.

Whan <hi>Herode</hi> hearde this, he was exceadinglye aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had diſcloſed his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete: &amp; began to miſtruſt with him ſelf that which <hi>Salumith</hi> had told him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had ſlept with his wife in dede, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that had detected that ſecret. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he departed out of his palaice in a greate anger and rage, wherby <hi>Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mith</hi> perceiued that he deteſted <hi>Marimi</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:22889:57"/>and therefore ſhe accuſed her fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hyring falſe accuſars and forgers of lies, to witnes that <hi>Marimi</hi> woulde haue poyſoned the kinge, whereof ſhe had diuers argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes alſo by her cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce. She added moreouer, if thou (ſaith ſhe to the king) let her ſcape thus ſhe wil ſpedely deſtroy thee, and bereue thee of thy kingdom. The lawe geueth a man this counſell. If any man gooe aboute to murther thee, preuent hym &amp; ſlea him firſt. With this and ſuche like wordes, ſhe ſo moued the king, that he commaunded to bring <hi>Marimi</hi> forthe, and to be beheaded in the hie ſtreate of the citie. And as ſhe was brought forth vnto the market place of the citie, all the women of the citie folowed her. <hi>Alexandra</hi> her mother alſo curſed and rayled at her, ſaiyng: come oute, thou that haſte abhorred thy huſbande, and conſpired againſt thy lorde. <hi>Alexandra</hi> wepte alſo as thoughe it hadde been for the wickednes that her doughter had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted: thinking ſuerly to pleaſe the king by that meanes, and to bleare

Wherfore ſhe bared her necke without feare, and thei cut of her head, ſheding the innocent bloud. But God made no delay in puniſhing the ſame: for there fell a ſore plague and peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the houſe of <hi>Herode,</hi> ſo that his chief ſeruauntes, his noble women and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines died ſore therof.

<pb facs="tcp:22889:59"/>none aunſwere, fearing left whan he had pulled it downe, he would not bee ſo haſty to builde it vp againe. But the the king perceauing what they feared in their mindes, ſaide: he woulde not flack the matter, nor reſte till he hade brought it to paſſe. He ſaid moreouer, that he would take out of his treaſure plentie of gold and ſyluer, and geue it to grauing: alſo precious ſtones, ſtones of Thaſies, &amp; marble. To the carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alſo and maſons, he would deliuer timber, &amp; ſtones, gold &amp; ſiluer, braſſe &amp; iron, to make all thinges neceſſary to the woorke. Wherefore if he pulled downe the houſe, he was able to builde it ſtreight waies again. So he pulled downe the houſe and repaired it again and finiſhed it, in length a hundred cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, in bredth lykewiſe a hundreth cubites, and in height a hundreth cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, all of white marble: ſo that the whole height of the ſtone work was in all a hundreth and .xx. cubites. For the foundacion was .xx. cubites within the grounde, and a hundreth aboue. The
<pb n="li" facs="tcp:22889:59"/>breadth of euery ſtone was .xii. cubites, and the thicknes thereof .viii. cubites, euery ſtone was of like bigneſſe. The gates of the houſe he couered with fine gold and precious ſtoones finely ſette therin: the threſholdes were of ſiluer &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tops alſo. He made alſo a vine of gold a marueilous cunning pece of worcke, the armes therof or bigger braunches were glittering gold, the leſſer braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſlips, or lateſt ſhutes of gold, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what red: &amp; al aboue was yelow gold, wherupon hong cluſters of criſtal. The vine was ſo great y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it weied a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pound weight of pure gold. In all the world was not the like to be ſeen. He made alſo a porche, &amp; before the porche ii, walles of ſiluer marueilous cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought. Behind y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe toward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weſt he made a court of .c. l. cubites lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, and a. C. in bredth: whiche was paued with pure marble.

The pillers were all of like meaſure, as the court of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> north ſide and of the South was alſo of like meaſure, with al the pilloures thereof. Toward the eaſt the court conteined. D. ccxx. cubites, euen to the broke Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron. No man euer ſe the like building in all the world.

Theſe thinges done, the kinges two Sonnes <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> whiche he had by <hi>Marimi,</hi> came home from Rome to Ieruſalem in a greate heate and fury, with a ſtronge compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yea their hartes were verye hautye alſo: for <hi>Alexander</hi> the elder had mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the kinge of <hi>Capadocies</hi> doughter, and <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> the doughter of <hi>Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mith</hi> the king his fathers ſiſter.

Moreouer, all his men gaue him warning to take hede of them, and to kepe his power or gard about him. He had had a wife of baſe ſtocke out of the country, before he came to the kingdome, by whome he had a ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne named <hi>Antipater.</hi> And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had put <hi>Marimi</hi> his beloued wife to

This <hi>Antipater</hi> had a ſubtile witte and a crafty, for he ſaid dailye to his father. If it like your maieſty wherto ſhould you geue me al theſe thinges, when as theſe two lions ſhalbe euer in my top, and ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy me. By ſuch ſurmiſed meanes he raiſed diſcord and hatred betwene them and their father. Albeit the kinge was lothe to hurt his two ſonnes. Not long after he toke his iourney to Rome to <hi>Octauian</hi> &amp; his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne <hi>Alexander</hi> waited vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, hoping y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

When the king was come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Octauian</hi> reioyſed much of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uring, ſaying: I haue thought lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to ſe

So he tolde him the whole matter from the beginning to the end. Then <hi>Octauian Auguſtus</hi> blamed the yonge manne becauſe he hated his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The yong man anſwered. Howe can I otherwiſe do? How can I forget the mooſte chaſte wombe that bare me, whiche was of the holye ſtocke? If I forget my mother that was ſlaine giltleſſe and withoute crime: then let me forget my righthand.

<pb n="liiii" facs="tcp:22889:62"/>and biddinge him honoure his father, &amp; ſubmit him ſelfe vnto him. When he had done as he was willed (for he wold not ſtriue againſt the Emperoures co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement). <hi>Octauian</hi> toke the yong man by the hande, and put it into <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes</hi> boſome. Then his father kiſſed him and embraſed him, ſo that they wepte eche of them.

Whereupon when he came home to Ieruſalem, he called together al thelders of Iſraell &amp; ſaid vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I had determined once to place one of my ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes captain ouer the people of the Lord, but I might not do it without the conſent of <hi>Octauian Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus.</hi> Now therfore I haue appointed my .iii. ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, &amp; haue deuided my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> equally emongſt them.

<pb facs="tcp:22889:63"/>And if ye perceiue any breach of trend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip betwene them, do that lieth in you to take it awaye. Whereunto he made them ſweare preſentlye in Ieruſalem: and the bonde made, eche man depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted home to his houſe. But for all this the hatred betwene <hi>Antipater</hi> and his two brethren was nothinge dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: for he feared them becauſe they were of the houſe of <hi>Chaſmonani,</hi> and alied with kinges of greate power: he ſuborned therfore falſe accuſers to ſay vnto the king, that the yong men, ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of <hi>Marimi,</hi> were determined to deſtroy him. Likewiſe he ſet variance betwene <hi>Salumith</hi> and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for ſhe was in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtimacion then he: in ſo muche that the kinge did nothinge withoute her counſell. The ſame wroughte he alſo betwene <hi>Pheroras</hi> the kinges brother and them. But to <hi>Salumith</hi> he ſaied: doeſt thou not conſider how the ſonnes of <hi>Marimi</hi> knowe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their mother was put to death by thy counſel. Therfore if they maye bringe to paſſe to make the king away: they wil hew thee to peces.
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:22889:63"/>But when the yong men herd of this: they came before the king, &amp; ſware thei neuer entended to hurt their father, and with weping they perſwaded the king that he beleued them, and they gote his fauour again. Wherat <hi>Antipater</hi> was not a litle diſpleaſed: wherfore he hired falſ witneſſes to ſay they ſaw <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the kinges ſonne vppon a certaine night with his ſword drawn before the kinges palaice, mindinge to murther <hi>Antipater.</hi> He ſuborned alſo certaine of the kinges ſeruauntes to witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he ſhould geue them great rewardes to allure them to his pleaſure, and to abuſe them in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy buggery, which they refuſed. More ouer, that he deſired them to poiſon the king, which they wold not alſo agre to do. Wherupon the kinge was ſore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed towarde him, commaundinge not only him, but al that toke his parte or defended his integritye: to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and put in priſon, that executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mighte be done vppon them. Then <hi>Alexander</hi> writ vnto <hi>Archelaus</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

When he was come to Hieruſalem, <hi>Herode</hi> was very glad of his comming: and demaunded what matters brought hym thether at that preſent. He aunſwered: I haue hearde that <hi>Alexander</hi> thy ſonne, and my ſonne in lawe, hath attempted to rebel againſt thee: it is not poſſible but my doughter his wife ſhoulde be acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarye of this thinge, and yet ſhe hathe not ſhewed it vnto the: wherfore I vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deteſt her, as one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath conſpired againſt thee.

But the ſeller tolde him not what it was, before he hadde bought it and paide deare for it. Then whiſpered he in his eare, tellinge him that it was a ſtrong poiſon, that would kil one out of hand. This Vyal <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater</hi> ſente to <hi>Pheroras</hi> to be kepte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he retourned from Rome.

Wherfore hear my wordes, as for them that be wiſe maye perceiue the matter them ſelues: they that lacke experience, let them learne wiſdom at my ſayinges. Kepe therfore ſilence, whiche ſhalbe as well to mine, as to your owne commodity, for I ſhal not nede to ſtreine my ſelfe but ſpeake the ſoftlier, with leſſe pain: and ye on the other ſide may the better heare and vnderſtand what I ſay. If ye holde not your peace, ye ſhall haue two diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: ye ſhall interrupte my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and let your ſelues from hearinge. But nowe to the purpoſe, ye ſhalbe content and ſuffer til I write to Rome of theſe matters, that <hi>Ceſar</hi> mai remoue theſe euill rulers, and ſende vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be more humain and ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle. If ye may haue once ſuch, then ſhal ye not thinke your ſelues in bondage, but in libertie, and worthilye: for then only is ſeruitude greuous, whan as the ruler is an vniuſte manne and wicked.
<pb n="lxxi" facs="tcp:22889:79"/>Now therfore ſtay your ſelues: quarell not with them, for althoughe they bee wicked, yet wyll they be aſhamed to do wrong openly, as that that they do, thei do it ſecretly. But if ye ſhuld accuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to much, thei would rub their foreheads and do it openly without all ſhame: ſo ſhoulde you make of your iudges and rulers, your open enemies. <hi>But it vvere farre better to ſuffer an vniuſt gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, then a iuſt enemie.</hi> For the one robbeth men priuely: the other is an open deſtroier, prouoke them not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

The ſame ye maye perceaue in a ſeuer and an agew, which if a man wil go about to cure at the beginning, he ſhall make it more greuous: but if he will remedy it by leaſure, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruencie of it wil eaſly

If ye be vtterly determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Romaine Empire, you ſhal vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand you be in no wiſe able to dooe it: for god is euery where on their ſide, ſo that they be Lordes throughout all the worlde, and all people ſerue them: and ſhall, till their ende alſo come. But if ye will not dooe this for your owne ſakes: yet do it for your own countreis ſake, your children and wifes, the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary &amp; prieſtes, whome ye are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den to loue and ſpare, leaſt ye caſte awaye and vndoe all them at once.

If you will be ruled and chuſe peace, I will take your parte and dooe the beſte I can for you: but if ye wyll nedes haue warres, ye ſhall haue it alone for me, I will not medle with you. With this <hi>Agrippas</hi> fell on weping, and ſo did alſo all the elders with him, and the men of moſte wyſdome, the chiefe in all Iſraell: yea, <hi>Ananie</hi> the hie prieſt alſo coulde nor refreine from teares.

The hoſte of the Iewes without the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſaide vnto them: Wee come frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto you, and would aide you. The other Iewes within annſwered: Wee
<pb n="lxxv" facs="tcp:22889:83"/>will neither your frendſhip nor aide. The armie of the Iewes hearing that, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented and agreed to raiſe their ſiege, to goe to Hieruſalem, and there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. For thei had a huge bootie of goulde and ſiluer that they had gotten together of the ſpoiles of Siria. After this, the Sirians that dwelt in <hi>Scitho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> ſaide one to another: Putcaſe the Iewes returne agayne &amp; make warre vpon vs: ſurelye if they ſhoulde ſo do, theſe Iewes that dwell amongeſt vs would ioine with them, and deliuer vp the Citye into their handes, and then woulde they be reuenged vpon vs, and diſtroy vs as they haue done the other cities of Siria.

<pb facs="tcp:22889:84"/>content to fulfil their mindes, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out of the citye, and placed them ſelues in the woode. There was amongſt them a certaine yonge man named <hi>Schime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> a good man of watre, fearce, bigge made, and verye ſtronge withall: he in fauoure of the gentiles had ſlaine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye of the Iewes, and ſolde muche of the people of God. For duringe the time that the Iewes beſieged <hi>Sitho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis:</hi> he iſſued oute continuallye, and ſkirmiſhed with the hoſt of the Iewes, many times puttinge them to flighte, and neuer would ſuffer them to waſte the towne or to do anye harme to the inhabitauntes thereof. Nowe as this <hi>Schimeon</hi> with his father <hi>Saule</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt old man, and the reaſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Iewes that dwelte in <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thopolis,</hi> remained all together boldly in the woode, withoute miſtruſtinge anye harme: the Romaines ioyned with the <hi>Sirians</hi> in greate nomber, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the woode and ſlew the Iewes all that euer they could finde, to the nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of .xiii. thouſande. <hi>Schimeon</hi> him

But when as a huge multitude inuironed him, and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that all the reaſte of the Iewes were ſlaine, and he with his houſholde onlye remained, nether ſawe he anye waye to eſcape: he ſtepte vppon a little hyll wyth hys naked ſwearde, ſayinge: Harken vnto me ye <hi>Sirians</hi> and Romaines and ye that dwell in <hi>Scithopoles,</hi> I will ſpeake vnto you a fewe woordes full of lamentacion and ſorowe. Nowe I perceiue that iuſtli and not without a cauſe ye make warre againſt me, withoute any fauor or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideracion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue deliuered you from the hoſtes of the Iewes, &amp; neuer ſuffred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do any diſpleſure to you,

But in dede God of his iuſt iudgmente hathe ſtirred you vp to rewarde me in this ſorte, to murther me that haue ſo oft receiued you. Now therfore ye ſhall beare me witneſſe that I ſhal ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſharpli inough take vengeaunce of my ſelf, not withoute rage and furye moſt ſeuerly, becauſe I haue ſlaine my felowes &amp; frendes.

And ye ſhal wel perceiue me to be of that hardineſſe &amp; courage that rather
<pb n="lxxvii" facs="tcp:22889:85"/>then ye ſhuld ſlea me, and after boaſt &amp; bragge how ye haue killed <hi>Schimeon:</hi> I wil bereue my ſelfe of my life and puniſhe the ſheadinge of my brothers bloud none otherwiſe then the law pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth a murtherer and a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queller. When he had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, his eies were filled with bloud &amp; his face with rage, and ſo inflamed with furie, latynge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte all pity: ran and caught holde of his father, haled him oute of the woode and ſlue him, Then ſlue he his mother leaſt ſhe ſhould intreat him for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and be ſory for their ſakes. That done, his wife came runninge of hir owne accord, and held her necke downe to the ſword: leaſte ſhe ſhoulde be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſee her children die. Yea, <hi>Schimeons</hi> children came and offered them ſelues to be ſlain: leaſt they ſhould ſee the deathe of their father, or remain after him to be deliuered to the enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. After this he ſlue all his hole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that not one of his ſhoulde come into the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of their enemies. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, he gathered their bodies together
<pb facs="tcp:22889:86"/>into one place like a valiaunte ſtoute warrioure, and then boldlye goarded him ſelfe vpon his owne ſworde, leaſt any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> elſe ſhould impare his ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, or boaſt that he had killed him. Al this <hi>Schimeon</hi> did with a greate courage to take puniſhment of him ſelf, becauſe he had beſtowed his loue rather vpon ſtraungers then vpon his owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to declare his force and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode. So he died an abhominable and deteſtable death, ſaue onlye it was an argument of his hauty minde &amp; great courage, as it is ſaid before.</p>

Firſte they take a great long thicke beame, vpon the fore part wherof they put a great ſtrong heade, made like vnto a Rams heade, wiſh hornes al of principall ſtreng iron, the weight therof is as much as halfe the beame, and couereth the beame alſo to the middes. Then faſten they into the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ouer againſt the place that they entend to batter, two greate trees like maſtes of ſhipps, betwene which, they ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the beme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is called the ram with very ſtrong ropes made of hempe, the

At the hynder part of this beame from the wall warde, are ringes of iron ſurely faſtened, with ropes made of hempe and wire tied to them: that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the aſſaulters wil bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the walles, they puſhe forwarde the beame as though it were a ſpeare, and faſten his ſtrong hornes amongeſt the ſtones. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hang they weightes at the ringes in the hinder parte, and muche people a far of take holde of the ropes that come through the ringes behinde, and hale that hinder part of the beame vpon the ground: and by ſuche meanes they ſhake the wall that they made it to quake again. Thus in many places they wreſt and wrenche out the ſtones of the building, ſo that afterwards the wal falles downe. There be alſo other maner of engins, as an iron ram vpon foure wheles bounde with iron, and faſtened with iron nailes. To this they make foure feete as hath a Ramme, or moe as the bigneſſe of the beames requireth. The biggeſte for the moſte

Yea, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of the ſedicious is growen ſo farre, that the moſte parte of vs hadde rather be ſlaine of the Romaynes, then of oure brethren the Iewes. If ſo be it, ye be come to ayde them, ye ſhal vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande that ye offende our LORD God greuouſlye, to healpe ſynners and murtherers, that treade the People of GOD vnder their fete, like as menne treade Grapes in a wyne preſſe, and make the temple of the Lorde a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge place of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quellers and wicked perſons.

In that wee be armed as ye obiecte vnto vs: do ye not knowe that <hi>Vaſpaſian</hi> draweth nye to come to thys holy Citye?

But howe ſhoulde ye gather this, that wee come to ſuccoure the wycked and ſedicious that bee wyth you: when as from the firſte daye that euer wee and oure fathers were circumciſed, wee neuer ſwarued from the Lawe and commaundementes of the Lorde? Tell vs if there bee anye commaundement in the Lawe that biddeth a manne to ſtrenthen and mayntayne the power of the wicked, to the whyche wee are bounde to hearken, and to ayde theſe? God forbidde wee ſhoulde dooe this: for wee all, bothe that be here, and the other Edomites alſo bee ſeruauntes of the Lord and his people, to mayntaine and defende the lawe, the people, and the houſe of the Lorde. Whiles they were thus talkyng together, there roſe vp a greate cloude, and lightenynges were ſene wyth fire, darckeneſſe with mightye thunder claps and ſhowers of hail, that all that ſaw it were wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully afraied.

For I haue vewed his campe, and his power, and vnderſtande that hee entendes to morow to entermeddle with vs, which thou ſhalt doe in dede. And when thou ſeeſt me to iſſue againſt thee: thou ſhalt ſet thy ſtaffe in the reſte, and come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes

Then that town great <hi>Aſa</hi> once taken, thou ſhalt quicklye win all the reaſte. When <hi>Schimeon</hi> had harde this, he went and deliberated with his owne counſel: and they likt the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe beſt: wherfore, that they concluded vpon.

For ſomuch as none of you are ſo expert in the knowledge of warfare, as is <hi>Iacob,</hi> therfore behoueth it you to folow him in all thinges: if he ſet forwarde, ſet ye forwarde: wheras he pitcheth his tent,

Now after that with murders and ſlaughters amongſt your ſelues, you haue diſtroyed one another, and poluted the temple of the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye with the bloude of the murthered, neither haue ſpared your owne liues. You are become fewe in noumber, a ſmall ſorte of you is lefte: what hope haue you then to preuayle? Agayn, you haue ſtirred here and prouoked a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Nacion, whiche is ruler ouer all people, and hath ſubdued all other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, whiche alſo hath thoſe nacions in ſubiection vnder them, which ſomtime raigned ouer you.

Al bett I am not afraied only for this holy te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, &amp; moſte renoumed City leeſt it ſhulde be raced and diſtroied: but for the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices &amp; burntoffringes, leeſt they ſhuld ceaſe, as the dayly facrifice is ceaſſed. And why? For we haue ſinned againſt our Lord God, wherfore his ſhadowe is departed frome vs, bycauſe that in this ſame te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple we haue kept warres, whyche hath ben an habytacion of wicked, a tabcrnacle of ſeditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones: yea, euen the miniſters and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of God haue ye murthered, &amp; within the walles of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple haue ye ſhed innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t bloud without meaſure.

                  <p>THere were certaine men of Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem at that time that came to the Gates, ouercame the warde, and gate out with their wiues and children, and ſo eſcaped to the Romaynes, becauſe they could no lenger abide the famine and the iniquity of the ſedicious.

Wherfore the Romayns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued theim, and gaue them fode and ſuſtenaunce, but certain of them could not brouke nor take it becauſe of their great honger wherwith they had bene longe pined, and when the meat went downe into their bealyes, they dyed ſtraight.

Therfore <hi>Titus</hi> commaunded his men to do as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> bad them, wherby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Iewes recouered, and many dyed of the flyre. Theſe Iewes whiche were eſcaped thus out of Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the campes of the Romayne, had ſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp firſt their gold ſiluer, &amp; preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones to hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, leaſt thei ſhould be found of the ſedicious.

At length certaine Aramites and Arabians eſpiynge the Iewes to vſe this faſhion, tolde it amongſt their fellowes one to an other, and made a conſpyracye to laye wayte for the Iewes, and whom ſo euer that they
